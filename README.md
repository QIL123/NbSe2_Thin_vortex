# NbSe2_Thin_vortex
This repository contains all the raw data and the Matlab scripts required to recreate the figures appearing in the paper "Thickness-controlled order competition in few-layer superconducting NbSe2"

The code was written on MATLAB_R2021b

In order to successfully read and analyze the raw data with matlab, the package "SxmToMatlab" must be installed from the following link: https://github.com/ethz-micro/matlab_nanonis

In order to reproduce the figures in the paper, open the corresponding script in the directory "Scripts/Paper Figures". Note that the directory names in the code itself must be modified to fit the path to the raw data, as saved on your computer.
